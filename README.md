## Introduction
Book Description
"JAVA PROGRAMMING can show you how to quickly start developing useful programs, all while still mastering the basic principles of structured and object-oriented programming. 
Unique, reader-friendly explanations and meaningful programming exercises emphasize business applications and game creation while useful debugging exercises and contemporary case problems further expand your understanding. "

Originally used while at University to supplement Programming Modules. Now I've restarted reading to develop skills in the later chapters.
